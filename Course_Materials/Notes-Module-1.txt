GOOGLE ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS: MODULE 2 NOTES
Topic: The Impact of Data Today
============================================================

1. THE DATA ECOSYSTEM
---------------------
Definition: The collection of infrastructure, software, and people that gather,
store, and analyze data.

* Data Sources: Where data originates (sensors, transactions, social media).
* Data Processing: Cleaning and organizing raw data.
* Insights: The valuable conclusions drawn from analysis.

2. DATA LIFE CYCLE (The 6 Stages)
----------------------------------
1. Plan: Define objectives and what data is needed.
2. Capture: Collect data from various sources.
3. Manage: Store and maintain data security/integrity.
4. Analyze: Use tools to find patterns and trends.
5. Archive: Store data for long-term use but remove from active systems.
6. Destroy: Securely delete data when it's no longer needed.

3. DATA ANALYST VS. DATA SCIENTIST
----------------------------------
* Data Analyst: Focuses on "What happened?" and "Why?". Uses SQL,
  Tableau, and basic Python to help businesses make decisions now.
* Data Scientist: Focuses on "What will happen?". Uses Advanced Python,
  Machine Learning, and statistics to build predictive models.

4. STRUCTURED VS. UNSTRUCTURED DATA (80-90% of data is unstructured)
-----------------------------------
* Structured Data: Organized in rows and columns (e.g., SQL tables, Excel).
  Highly searchable and easy to analyze.
* Unstructured Data: No predefined format (e.g., photos, videos, emails,
  PDFs). Requires more advanced processing (like NLP or Computer Vision).

5. DATA ETHICS & PRIVACY
------------------------
* Data Privacy: Protecting the identity and personal info of individuals.
* Data Bias: When data is unrepresentative or reflects human prejudices.
* Transparency: Being clear about how data is collected and used.

6. KEY TERMS TO REMEMBER
------------------------
* Big Data: Massive volumes of data that cannot be processed by traditional tools.
* Cloud Computing: Using remote servers on the internet to store/process data.
* Algorithm: A set of rules or steps to solve a problem or perform a task.
============================================================

PII - Personally Identifiable Information - that permits the identity of an individual
to be inferred by either direct or indirect means (ID Number, Health Care Number etc)

============================================================

Data anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII.
Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information,
often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.

Data aggregation is the process of collecting and combining details from a significant
number of users in terms of totals or summary.

============================================================

RACI - Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed

Task
R - Business Intelligence - Engineer
C - Data Scientist
R - Analytics Team Manager
R - Data Engineer

============================================================

Study Notes: Data Applications and Workflow (Google Advanced DA)
====================================

The PACE Model – Your Professional Workflow
The core of this module is the PACE framework (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute),
designed to organize complex data projects and ensure they meet business goals.

1. Plan (Planning)
This stage is about defining the problem and setting the foundation.

Key Questions: What is the business goal? Who are the stakeholders? What data is available?

Tasks: Researching business data, defining the project scope, and identifying stakeholder needs.

2. Analyze (Analysis)
The phase where you get your "hands dirty" with the raw data.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Investigating the dataset to discover patterns, anomalies, and relationships.

Tasks: Data sourcing, data cleaning, and verifying statistical assumptions.

3. Construct (Building)
The technical heart of the project where models are developed.

Modeling: Selecting and applying appropriate machine learning algorithms or statistical methods.

Tasks: Building models, training them, testing their performance, and validating results.

4. Execute (Execution & Delivery)
The final stage of presenting findings and providing recommendations.

Communication: Translating complex data into actionable business stories (Data Storytelling).

Tasks: Interpreting results, creating visualizations, and presenting final insights to stakeholders.

📘 Professional Glossary
PACE: An acronym for Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute; a flexible workflow model for data science projects.

Stakeholder: Any individual or group, inside or outside an organization, who has an interest in the project's outcome.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): The process of exploring a dataset to summarize its main characteristics,
often using visual methods.

Project Scope: A document that defines the boundaries of a project—specifying what is included and what is not.

Predictive Modeling: The process of using historical data to predict future outcomes,
such as through regression or classification models.

Data Lifecycle: The various stages data goes through, from collection and processing to analysis, archival, or deletion.

Workflow: A structured sequence of steps and tasks required to complete a project from start to finish.

💡 Pro-tips for Data Professionals:
Iterative Process: PACE is not always linear. You may need to return from the Construct phase to Analyze
if you discover data quality issues mid-way.

Active Listening: Effective data professionals must practice active listening to fully understand
stakeholder needs before starting technical work.

Strategic Documentation: Keeping detailed notes during the Plan phase prevents "scope creep"
and ensures the project stays aligned with the original business objective.
