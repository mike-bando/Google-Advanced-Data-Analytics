GOOGLE ADVANCED DATA ANALYTICS: MODULE 2 NOTES
Topic: The Impact of Data Today
============================================================

1. THE DATA ECOSYSTEM
---------------------
Definition: The collection of infrastructure, software, and people that gather,
store, and analyze data.

* Data Sources: Where data originates (sensors, transactions, social media).
* Data Processing: Cleaning and organizing raw data.
* Insights: The valuable conclusions drawn from analysis.

2. DATA LIFE CYCLE (The 6 Stages)
----------------------------------
1. Plan: Define objectives and what data is needed.
2. Capture: Collect data from various sources.
3. Manage: Store and maintain data security/integrity.
4. Analyze: Use tools to find patterns and trends.
5. Archive: Store data for long-term use but remove from active systems.
6. Destroy: Securely delete data when it's no longer needed.

3. DATA ANALYST VS. DATA SCIENTIST
----------------------------------
* Data Analyst: Focuses on "What happened?" and "Why?". Uses SQL,
  Tableau, and basic Python to help businesses make decisions now.
* Data Scientist: Focuses on "What will happen?". Uses Advanced Python,
  Machine Learning, and statistics to build predictive models.

4. STRUCTURED VS. UNSTRUCTURED DATA (80-90% of data is unstructured)
-----------------------------------
* Structured Data: Organized in rows and columns (e.g., SQL tables, Excel).
  Highly searchable and easy to analyze.
* Unstructured Data: No predefined format (e.g., photos, videos, emails,
  PDFs). Requires more advanced processing (like NLP or Computer Vision).

5. DATA ETHICS & PRIVACY
------------------------
* Data Privacy: Protecting the identity and personal info of individuals.
* Data Bias: When data is unrepresentative or reflects human prejudices.
* Transparency: Being clear about how data is collected and used.

6. KEY TERMS TO REMEMBER
------------------------
* Big Data: Massive volumes of data that cannot be processed by traditional tools.
* Cloud Computing: Using remote servers on the internet to store/process data.
* Algorithm: A set of rules or steps to solve a problem or perform a task.
============================================================

PII - Personally Identifiable Information - that permits the identity of an individual
to be inferred by either direct or indirect means (ID Number, Health Care Number etc)

============================================================

Data anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII.
Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information,
often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.

Data aggregation is the process of collecting and combining details from a significant
number of users in terms of totals or summary.

============================================================

RACI - Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed

Task
R - Business Intelligence - Engineer
C - Data Scientist
R - Analytics Team Manager
R - Data Engineer

Study Notes: Data Applications and Workflow (Google Advanced DA)
============================================================

The PACE Model – Your Professional Workflow
The core of this module is the PACE framework (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute),
designed to organize complex data projects and ensure they meet business goals.

1. Plan (Planning)
This stage is about defining the problem and setting the foundation.

Key Questions: What is the business goal? Who are the stakeholders? What data is available?

Tasks: Researching business data, defining the project scope, and identifying stakeholder needs.

2. Analyze (Analysis)
The phase where you get your "hands dirty" with the raw data.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Investigating the dataset to discover patterns, anomalies, and relationships.

Tasks: Data sourcing, data cleaning, and verifying statistical assumptions.

3. Construct (Building)
The technical heart of the project where models are developed.

Modeling: Selecting and applying appropriate machine learning algorithms or statistical methods.

Tasks: Building models, training them, testing their performance, and validating results.

4. Execute (Execution & Delivery)
The final stage of presenting findings and providing recommendations.

Communication: Translating complex data into actionable business stories (Data Storytelling).

Tasks: Interpreting results, creating visualizations, and presenting final insights to stakeholders.

📘 Professional Glossary
PACE:
An acronym for Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute; a flexible workflow model for data science projects.

Stakeholder:
Any individual or group, inside or outside an organization, who has an interest in the project's outcome.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
The process of exploring a dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often using visual methods.

Project Scope:
A document that defines the boundaries of a project—specifying what is included and what is not.

Predictive Modeling:
The process of using historical data to predict future outcomes, such as through regression or classification models.

Data Lifecycle:
The various stages data goes through, from collection and processing to analysis, archival, or deletion.

Workflow:
A structured sequence of steps and tasks required to complete a project from start to finish.

💡 Pro-tips for Data Professionals:
Iterative Process:
PACE is not always linear. You may need to return from the Construct phase to Analyze if you discover data quality issues mid-way.

Active Listening:
Effective data professionals must practice active listening to fully understand stakeholder needs before starting technical work.

Strategic Documentation:
Keeping detailed notes during the Plan phase prevents "scope creep" and ensures the project stays aligned
with the original business objective.

Automatidata

Project goal:

In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)
has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares
in advance of their ride.

Background:

Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles,
commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

Scenario:

You are a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm.
Automatidata’s focus is to help clients transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions.
In this scenario, you will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app
that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride. Your first responsibility as a data analytics consultant
will be to structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project.

Course 1 tasks:

Gather information from the notes from the last executive meeting of Automatidata

Assign PACE stages to the requested tasks

Organize tasks into milestones

Create a project proposal for the executive team’s approval

Meeting notes
Now that you are working as Automatidata’s latest data analytics professional, you are given access to the company network and set up
with a company email account (your first initial and last name, followed by @automatidata.org).

Opening your inbox, you notice an email from your supervisor, Deshawn.

From: Deshawn Washington

Subject: Review meeting notes

If you are able to read this, then your company accounts have been created! Now is the perfect time to get started.
Last week, I attended an internal meeting with our leadership team about a new project we are about to begin.
You’ll receive more information in the next few days,
but I would like you to be aware of some needs that were identified by our leadership team.
Here is an excerpt from the notes I took during the Automatidata leadership team meeting.
I’ve organized the points by the person who made them.

Uli King  (Senior Project Manager)

The data team will need a global-level project document to outline the goals and milestones.

I am working closely with Titus Nelson over at the New York City Taxi and Limo Commission.
He has requested some visuals to share with TLC’s executives.

Luana Rodriquez (Senior Data Analyst)

The dataset from TLC has to be inspected before any analysis can begin.

Our team needs to determine what information the TLC data provides through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Eventually, our team will need to test to find if the model is delivering consistent results.

Udo Bankole (Director of Data Analysis)

Before we present any insights to TLC, we'll need to determine whether or not the model we produce meets the project requirements.

Once we have a final model, I'll need to know the main talking points going into our presentation with TLC.

My thoughts and concerns…

I think it's best to use Python for the TLC project. I'll have someone on my team set that up as soon as we have the plan in place.

It will be important to establish the relationship between any variables within the TLC data.
I'd suggest the data team consider A/B testing, since that will analyze the relationship between the two most useful variables
and subsequently provide data-driven support for future business decisions.

Review the meeting notes above to become familiar with the project’s context. I’ll ask you to identify project tasks and come up
with a structure to guide the data team through this project. After our discussion about your experience in the certificate program
offered by Google, I know that your efficient communication style and problem-solving will enhance the abilities of the data team.

There will be more details sent to you very soon.

Welcome to the team,

Deshawn Washington
